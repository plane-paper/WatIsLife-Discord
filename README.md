# WatIsLife-Discord

## About
A much easier render on Discord of the ongoing project [WatIsLife](https://github.com/plane-paper/WatIsLife). Requires some rights.

Counts how many time you've said you want to KYS.

## Commands and Usage

The only phrase that triggers a counter increment right now is "kill myself", in that exact fashion. I might add more keywords very soon.

The bot has three commands:
1. !depressionlevel - returns the count of the current user
2. !curedepression - resets the count of the current user
3. !watchlist - returns all users that have a count > 0, from highest count to lowest.

## Deployment
Use [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1349295351538126858&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot) to invite the bot to your server. It will ask for administrator rights, which is an overkill... but I'm too lazy to configure it right now. I *might* change it later. Who knows.

If the link expires or has other problems, please let me know by opening an issue on GitHub.

## Cloning and Additional Development
I really struggle to believe that this thing can be used in other projects, but if you wish, clone away.

If you aren't against me stealing your precious intellectual work, please consider opening a pull request (Please I'm begging on my knees I need people to fix my terrible program).
